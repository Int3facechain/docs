# Overview

## What is Neutron and why is it needed?
Neutron is a blockchain network that brings Smart Contracts into the Cosmos-family blockchains using [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com). Neutron works with networks using the IBC protocol. Neutron security (block validation) is provided by the [Cosmos Hub network](https://hub.cosmos.network) using [Interchain Security](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security).

### Cosmos SDK
Neutron is built using the Cosmos SDK framework. A generalized framework that simplifies the process of building secure blockchain applications on top of Tendermint BFT. It is based on two major principles: Modularity & capabilities-based security.

### Interchain Security
[Interchain Security](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security) is a technology which allows Neutron to be secured by the validator set of the Cosmos Hub and do not have another one separate validator set particularly for the Neutron blockchain.

### Interchain Queries
Neutron is bringing customizable Interchain Queries to smart contract developers.
Interchain Queries (aka ICQs) are an essential building block enabling devs to securely retrieve data from remote zones.

### Interchain Transactions
Neutron is bringing interchain accounts (ICA) to CosmWasm smart-contracts.
ICAs allow modules and smart contracts to execute and track transactions on foreign zones, without deploying additional code. With ICQs, they're the Interchain's secret DeFi sauce.

### CosmWasm
CosmWasm is a smart contracting platform built for the Cosmos ecosystem.
