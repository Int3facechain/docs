# Overview

The main topic we want to cover here is how to build and run a Neutron node in a standalone way. If you need only a Neutron node to be running and plan no interactions with other chains or you have your own setup for running a sidechain and relaying applications, stick with the [Neutron node sole running manual](/neutron/build-and-run/neutron-docker). This is the easiest way how to get a running Neutron node.

However, we assume that a ready-to-use multi-chain setup with relayers inbetween can also be handy for developers who want to deploy on Neutron. Therefore we desided to describe a guide how to run a Neutron node along with a Gaia node connected via a Hermes IBC Relayer and a Neutron ICQ Relayer. The Neutron's integration tests project is the base for this setup. If this is your case, stick with the [Cosmopark running manual](/neutron/build-and-run/cosmopark). This is likely your option if you're up to create a smart contract that will take advantage of [Neutron cosmwasm SDK](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-sdk) and its interchain queries and interchain transactions. This is a more advanced section than the basic sole Neutron node flow.

Overall, these sections can be useful if you're up to develop/debug/test your Neutron-related apps and smart contracts. If you need to prepate a production version of Neutron, please refer to [this repository](https://github.com/neutron-org/mainnet-assets) which contains all details you need.
