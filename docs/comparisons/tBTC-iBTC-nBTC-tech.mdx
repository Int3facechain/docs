![1](/docs/assets/images/tbtc_components-493a4be7125e5d1988a972b221a34ac4.png)

To start the tBTC node validator needs:

1. tBTC node

2. Access to the Ethereum API

   * By running their own ETH node
   * OR using 3rd-party RPC provider

3. Access to the Bitcoin API - tBTC requires using Electrum protocol for BTC communication

   * By running their own Electrum Personal Server (includes full BTC node)
   * OR using public Electrum Server

To start the iBTC node validator needs:

1. iBTC node

2. Observer node

3. Access to the Int3face API
   * By running their own INT3 node

4. Access to the Bitcoin API

   * By running their own node
   * OR using 3rd-party dedicated node

# tBTC Hardware Recommendations

Recommended hardware to run a singe tBTC v2 node: 2 vCPU / 2 GB RAM / 1 GiB Persistent Storage

# iBTC Hardware Recommendations

Estimated recommended hardware to run a single iBTC node: 8 vCPU / 64 GB RAM / 1+ TB Persistent Storage

# tBTC signing timeline

1. Signers announce readiness - \~1.2 minutes (6 ETH blocks)
2. Signature production - \<= 6 minutes (\<= 30 ETH blocks)
3. Cooldown - \~1 minute (5 ETH blocks)

In total - \~8 minutes (41 ETH blocks)

In case of signature failure - next attempt will be performed after 41 block window. Maximum is 5 signing attempts. Worst case scenario - signature will take 205 blocks or \~40 minutes on ETH

# iBTC signing timeline

According to the [Thorchain's benchmarks](https://github.com/thorchain/Resources/blob/master/Whitepapers/THORChain-TSS-Benchmark-July2020.pdf) TSS signature production for 10 nodes takes around 10 seconds.

In case of signature failure - next attempt will be performed ASAP. We have a total timeout of 5 minutes for signing.
