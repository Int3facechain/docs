This is the demo of the inbound and outbound transfer flow in the Int3face for the DOGE tokens.

**Requirements**

1. Int3face node
2. Int3face observer (configured for the DOGE regtest)
3. [DOGE regtest node](/docs/int3face/build-and-run/doge_deploy)

We have everything deployed and ready in the Int3face testnet. Request Int3face team to get access to the testnet environment.

Current Dogecoin vault address: `mtjLBcip4TAy7kSEsVoYKK5zvz1YY1Zy4F`

## Inbound Transfer[​](#inbound-transfer "Direct link to Inbound Transfer")

We will use our own DOGE validators funds.

1. We need an int3 address to send funds to

We can generate new address by `int3faced keys add "$your_key_name"`. ![new\_key](/docs/assets/images/new_key-5dc20bffc1ac37f497a9e042dcbefbdc.png)

We will use the address `int31nx72wqe9js9n0tvk9c2w4zwgwv6kecp0n4zllt`

2. Lets verify that this address doesn't have DOGE tokens in the Int3face

```
int3faced q bank balances int31nx72wqe9js9n0tvk9c2w4zwgwv6kecp0n4zllt
```

![init\_balance](/docs/assets/images/init_balance-cb7d9420be2fefa3a49550e805ce5aaa.png)

3. Select an UTXO to spend

```
dogecoin-cli listunspent 
```

![list\_unspent](/docs/assets/images/list_unspent-b432897e408ddfcf2b15bca5c706fa5b.png)

If you don't see any UTXO available, mine a block to receive the rewards `dogecoin-cli generate 1`, and run `listunspent` command again.

4. Build raw transaction from the UTXO you selected

**Vins**

* Take the `txid` and `vout` from the UTXO you're going to spend

**Vouts**

* Add the DOGE vault address and the amount to send
* Add the change address to get remaining tokens back (to get address of your current node run `dogecoin-cli getaccountaddress ""`)
* Leave a small amount of tokens to pay the fee (1.0 should be enough)
* Add `data` entry with the hex encoded recipient address
  * Encode `int31nx72wqe9js9n0tvk9c2w4zwgwv6kecp0n4zllt` at the (online converter)\[https\://www\.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-to-hex.html]

```
vins='[    {        "txid": "c4a12ff2916393d4a05ca446ab03d8cdf706dd6eb9b5d62eb8ab82cb08a01602",        "vout": 0    }]'vouts='{    "mtjLBcip4TAy7kSEsVoYKK5zvz1YY1Zy4F": 100000.0,    "mzd3LWrYrBD2qqiKwCcetReLtNC9Sfcr3j": 399999.0,    "data": "696E7433316E783732777165396A73396E3074766B39633277347A77677776366B656370306E347A6C6C74"}'dogecoin-cli createrawtransaction "$vins" "$vouts"
```

![raw\_transaction](/docs/assets/images/raw_transaction-390e2fd584e41dc428694389a31fcd15.png)

5. We can verify that the transaction is correct

```
dogecoin-tx -regtest -json "$raw_tx"
```

![decoded\_raw\_transaction](/docs/assets/images/decoded_raw_transaction-7f06a7d6c23be5a21154a87078210dc3.png)

6. Sign the transaction

```
dogecoin-cli signrawtransaction $raw_tx
```

![signed\_tx](/docs/assets/images/signed_transaction-972fd91f474a138230b8ceafb88ae002.png)

7. Broadcast signed transaction to the DOGE

```
dogecoin-cli sendrawtransaction $signed_tx
```

![send\_doge\_transaction](/docs/assets/images/send_doge_transaction-17d9bebaea539f27f03dbd1b736c63f3.png)

8. Generate a block to include our transaction in the chain

```
dogecoin-cli generate 1
```

Now the transaction should be observed by the Observer and sent to the Int3face chain.

9. Check your balance on the Int3face chain.

```
int3faced q bank balances int31nx72wqe9js9n0tvk9c2w4zwgwv6kecp0n4zllt
```

![inbound\_balance](/docs/assets/images/inbound_balance-8520ee05b4bbc657d270cd700777f795.png) Now, we can see DOGE tokens in our wallet.

## Outbound Transfer[​](#outbound-transfer "Direct link to Outbound Transfer")

Lets send some of our tokens back from Int3face to DOGE.

1. Generate a new DOGE address

```
dogecoin-cli getnewaddressmsJf78psekNDSaQwCA2qhYypJqVPWaCCAg
```

2. Request an outbound transfer from the bridge module

```
int3faced tx bridge outbound-transfer msJf78psekNDSaQwCA2qhYypJqVPWaCCAg dogecoin-doge 5000000000000 --from doge_test
```

![outbound\_transaction](/docs/assets/images/outbound_transaction-14d638f95725bb1a1f081691b515371d.png)

3. We can check our balance again to see that DOGE tokens in Int3face were burt

```
int3faced q bank balances int31nx72wqe9js9n0tvk9c2w4zwgwv6kecp0n4zllt
```

![outbound\_balance](/docs/assets/images/outbound_balance-3e8d3edc1db093d8018b7b6f0b9cdadb.png)

4. Generate a block in DOGE to include transaction from the vault

```
dogecoin-cli generate 1
```

5. Check DOGE balance of the address we created before

```
dogecoin-cli listunspent 1 9999999 '["msJf78psekNDSaQwCA2qhYypJqVPWaCCAg"]'
```

![outbound\_doge\_balance](/docs/assets/images/outbound_doge_balance-d31d0daa0605ff6f8f0e41fc4b443dae.png) Now, we can see DOGE tokens in our wallet.
