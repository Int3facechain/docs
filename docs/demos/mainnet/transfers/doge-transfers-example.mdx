9. **Verify on Explorer** Visit the Int3face Ping.Pub Explorer to verify your transaction. You can check your int3face address and see the transaction history [here](http://95.217.153.1/explorer/int3face-1/account/%7Byour_int3face_address%7D).

# Outbound transfer using CLI

## Preconditions:[​](#preconditions-1 "Direct link to Preconditions:")

* First option: Int3face node is installed and running on the int3face-1 mainnet.
* Second option: You also can use int3faced binary just as a CLI client and connect to the int3face-1 full-node - [http://162.55.33.158:26657](http://162.55.33.158:26657). (In this case you don\`t need to install the full node on your machine, but must install the int3faced binary).

## Steps:[​](#steps-1 "Direct link to Steps:")

1. **Option 1**: If you have an Int3face node installed, you can perform an outbound transfer immediately.

2. **Option 2**: If you want to use only CLI as a client, you need to import a key to the Int3face node.

   Import an existing key using mnemonic:

   ```
   int3faced keys add key_name --recover
   ```

   Check the key list:

   ```
   int3faced keys list
   ```

   Check address balances:

   ```
   int3faced q bank balances {your_int3face_address} --node http://162.55.33.158:26657
   ```

3. **Perform Outbound Transfer**

   Use the following command to transfer (add --node [http://162.55.33.158:26657](http://162.55.33.158:26657) flag if you use Option 2)

   Command template:

   ```
   int3faced tx bridge outbound-transfer {recipient_address} {asset} {amount} --from {key_name} --chain-id int3face-1
   ```

   Example of transfer 1 DOGE (note that amount is in satoshis (\* 10^8) for DOGE and other UTXO denoms):

   ```
   int3faced tx bridge outbound-transfer D7g8fBaUG9wDw93Ri1PBGAYd7mQxxFdubH dogecoin-doge 100000000 --from ove-validator --chain-id int3face-1
   ```

   Tx execution result:

4. **Check the Transaction Status**

   After tx is executed, copy tx hash, you can check the transaction status in the Int3face Pig.Pub explorer.

   Link example -> [http://95.217.153.1/explorer/int3face-1/tx/6E360EF7CCA387F0A4F73E8AEF61716CC4C223FEA35844511E82EC7F31ED54FA](http://95.217.153.1/explorer/int3face-1/tx/6E360EF7CCA387F0A4F73E8AEF61716CC4C223FEA35844511E82EC7F31ED54FA).

5. **Verify on DOGE Explorer**

   Also, check the balance of the recipient address in the DOGE explorer. You can find your DOGE address and see transactions list.

   Link example -> [https://dogechain.info/address/D7g8fBaUG9wDw93Ri1PBGAYd7mQxxFdubH](https://dogechain.info/address/D7g8fBaUG9wDw93Ri1PBGAYd7mQxxFdubH).

# IBC Transfer using CLI

## Preconditions:[​](#preconditions-2 "Direct link to Preconditions:")

* First option: Int3face node is installed and running on the int3face-1 mainnet.
* Second option: You also can use int3faced binary just as a CLI client and connect to the int3face-1 full-node - [http://162.55.33.158:26657](http://162.55.33.158:26657). (In this case you don\`t need to install the full node on your machine, but must install the int3faced binary).

## Steps:[​](#steps-2 "Direct link to Steps:")

1. **Option 1**: If you have an Int3face node installed, you can perform an outbound transfer immediately.

2. **Option 2**: If you want to use only CLI as a client, you need to import a key to the Int3face node.

   Import an existing key using mnemonic:

   ```
   int3faced keys add key_name --recover
   ```

   Check the key list:

   ```
   int3faced keys list
   ```

   Check address balances:

   ```
   int3faced q bank balances {your_int3face_address} --node http://162.55.33.158:26657
   ```

3. **Perform IBC Transfer**

   Use the following command (add --node [http://162.55.33.158:26657](http://162.55.33.158:26657) flag if you use a second option):

   Command template:

   ```
   int3faced tx ibc-transfer transfer {source-port} {source-channel} {receiver_address} {amount}{denom} --from {key_name} --chain-id int3face-1 --fees 10000uint3 --gas auto --packet-timeout-height 0-10000 --packet-timeout-timestamp 600000000000
   ```

   Example of transfer 1 IBC token (note that amount is in satoshis (\* 10^8) for DOGE and other UTXO denoms):

   ```
   int3faced tx ibc-transfer transfer \transfer \channel-0 \osmo1jssqq9mas2dg5p5x847fz0n58uqqz2nl9q9mhy \10000factory/int31zlefkpe3g0vvm9a4h0jf9000lmqutlh99h7fsd/dogecoin-doge \--from ove-validator \--chain-id int3face-1 \--fees 10000uint3 \--gas auto \--packet-timeout-height 0-10000 \--packet-timeout-timestamp 600000000000
   ```

4. **Verify on Mintscan Explorer**

   After tx is executed, you can monitor tokens received in the recipient address using Mintscan.

   Link example -> [https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/address/osmo1jssqq9mas2dg5p5x847fz0n58uqqz2nl9q9mhy](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/address/osmo1jssqq9mas2dg5p5x847fz0n58uqqz2nl9q9mhy).

   Navigate to the 'Transactions' tab to see the transaction details.
