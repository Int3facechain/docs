## Steps to implement[​](#steps-to-implement "Direct link to Steps to implement")

1. Find libraries to run all the nodes in docker containers (there may be some dedicated repos to run BTC and DOGE): [79](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/79).
2. Scaffold tests, test utilities and helpers: [80](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/80).
3. Test `Inbound transfer`: [81](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/81).
4. Test `Outbound transfer`: [82](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/82).
5. Test `Key generation`: [83](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/83).
6. Test `Vault migration: inbound transfer to the new vault`: [84](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/84).
7. Test `Vault migration: outbound transfer from the new vault`: [85](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/85).
8. Test `Vault migration: multiple chains`: [86](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/86).
9. Test `Observer shutdown after vault migration`: [87](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/87).
10. Research how to run tests in the CI/CD: [88](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/88).
