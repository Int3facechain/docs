## Status[​](#status "Direct link to Status")

Done

## Context[​](#context "Direct link to Context")

We want to collect business and infrastructure metrics from both observer and int3face node binaries.

## Implementation[​](#implementation "Direct link to Implementation")

1. Implement log aggregation.
2. Add metrics for the number of incoming and outgoing transactions.
3. Add metrics for total vault supply.
4. Add metrics for total Cosmos-represented asset supply.
5. Calculate and monitor the ratio between vault and Cosmos asset supplies.
6. Monitor incoming and outgoing transaction volume.
7. Monitor node status, including health status and current height.
8. Implement TSS metrics.

Use [this template](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/16846-aptos-validator-monitoring/) as a reference.

## Steps to implement[​](#steps-to-implement "Direct link to Steps to implement")

1. Determine how to scrape metrics from nodes: [71](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/71).
2. Set up metrics storage: [72](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/72).
3. Research methods to expose and modify Cosmos-based metrics: [73](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/73).
4. Add business and infrastructure metrics for the Int3face node: [74](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/74).
5. Add business and infrastructure metrics for the Observer node: [75](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/75).
6. Deploy the metrics infrastructure to Hetzner: [76](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/76).
7. Set up a metrics dashboard using the reference template: [77](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/77).

## Solution[​](#solution "Direct link to Solution")

1. Implemented monitoring based on Prometheus and Grafana.

2. Prometheus and Grafana are deployed by docker-compose.

3. Also running as a demon:

   1. node-exporter to collect node metrics.
   2. cosmos-exporter to collect Cosmos metrics.

4. Monitoring repository: [int3face-monitoring](https://github.com/Int3facechain/monitoring) contains:

   1. Prometheus & Grafana configs
   2. Deployment scripts
   3. Docker-compose file
   4. Dashboards

5. Grafana dashboard (Hetzner): [int3face-monitoring](http://95.217.153.1:3000/d/cosmos_validator/int3face-monitoring?orgId=1\&refresh=1m)

   1. Login: `admin`
   2. Password: \{please ask from a team member}

6. Prometheus (Hetzner): [prometheus-ui](http://95.217.153.1:9099/graph)
