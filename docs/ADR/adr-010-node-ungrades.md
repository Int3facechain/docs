# ADR-010: Node Upgrades

## Status

In progress

## Context

The Int3face chain requires regular updates to its node software to maintain security, stability, and performance. \
Node upgrades are essential to patch vulnerabilities, introduce new features, and ensure compatibility with the latest blockchain standards. \
By keeping the nodes up-to-date, we can enhance the network's resilience, scalability, and overall functionality.

## Steps to implement

- Research the best practices for node upgrades in blockchain networks - [#121](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/121)
- Develop a node upgrades for the Int3face chain - [#122](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/122)
- Add automated tests to verify the node upgrade process - [#123](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/123)
- Made the solution well documented and easy to follow for validators - [#124](https://github.com/Int3facechain/bridge/issues/124)
